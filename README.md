# Linear Regression to Predict MPG (Part 1)
1. The most outstanding variables that provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset were ground_clearance (pvalue = 5.77e-08) and vehicle_length (pvalue =  2.60e-12).
2. The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero due to the coefficient of the variables being not equal to 0. 
3. This linear model represents mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively. R^2 = 0.7149 which scales this model to be about 71.49% accurate.
