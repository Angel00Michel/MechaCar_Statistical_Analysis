# Linear Regression to Predict MPG (Part 1)
1. The most outstanding variables that provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset were ground_clearance (pvalue = 5.77e-08) and vehicle_length (pvalue =  2.60e-12).
2. The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero due to the coefficient of the variables being not equal to 0. 
3. This linear model represents mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively. R^2 = 0.7149 which scales this model to be about 71.49% accurate.

# Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
- The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils determine that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. 
- The total Summary shows that variance is under 100 which is acceptable (62.2), on the other hand the lot summary depicts that lot 3 is over 100PSI (170) which is NOT acceptable.
